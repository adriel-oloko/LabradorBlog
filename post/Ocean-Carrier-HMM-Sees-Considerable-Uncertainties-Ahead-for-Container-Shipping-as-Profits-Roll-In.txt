<p>South Korea&rsquo;s national flagship carrier,&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/tag/hmm/">HMM</a>, reported a net profit of $2.24bn in the second quarter, for a $4.62bn half-year result &ndash; but is decidedly pessimistic on the outlook.</p>
<p>Similarly, last week, Maersk said it&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/maersk-upgrades-guidance-amid-lingering-congestion-in-container-shipping/">expected</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;a progressive decline&rdquo; from the fourth quarter, and ONE has so far&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/one-reports-record-quarterly-profit-more-than-double-2021/">declined to forecast</a>&nbsp;earnings for its full year, ending on 31 March, due to &ldquo;market uncertainties&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/container-shipping-lines-set-to-smash-profit-record/">very profitable</a>&nbsp;third quarter now guaranteed for the sector, John McCown, founder of New York-based analyst Blue Alpha Capital, has raised his 2022 ocean carrier cumulative earnings forecast by $36bn, to a massive $256bn.</p>
<p>However, it looks more and more likely that the liner boom has&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/xeneta-says-long-term-container-rates-may-have-peaked/">reached its peak</a>&nbsp;and earnings next year will come under considerable pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demand growth is expected to be under downward pressure due to considerable uncertainties mainly related to widespread inflation, rising oil prices and recurrent Covid outbreaks, in addition to geopolitical tensions,&rdquo; said HMM.</p>
<p>The carrier&rsquo;s revenue surged 73% in Q2, compared with Q2 21, to $3.84bn, and edged up 2.3% on Q1 turnover as its spot market business began to cool.</p>
<p>HMM does not reveal its liftings and its average rate per teu cannot be calculated, but The Alliance partner ONE reported a 5% decline in its volumes for the same period, so, based on the financial information disclosed, HMM&rsquo;s average rates would appear to have increased during the period.</p>
<p>Whereas, Maersk said it expected to have around 70% of its main haul business&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/confident-maersk-builds-19-billion-ma-war-chest/">under contract</a>&nbsp;by the end of the year, HMM is known to be less reliant on large volume contracts with BCOs and more focused on small-to-medium-sized shippers for its volume.</p>
<p>Despite its pessimism over demand, HMM will no doubt hope its reading of the global supply chain &ldquo;to remain strained in the coming months&rdquo; will keep spot and shorter-term contract rates elevated for the next few quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/drewry-beginning-of-the-end-for-container-shippings-bull-run/">Port congestion</a>&nbsp;in major locations is still pervasive. In particular, growing concern about the logistics situation in&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/shipping-alliances-drop-hundreds-of-asia-north-europe-port-calls-due-to-congestion/">North Europe</a>&nbsp;is an important factor that will impact the supply chain,&rdquo; said HMM.</p>
<p>Formerly known as Hyundai Merchant Marine, the carrier&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/hmm-returns-to-black-for-first-time-in-five-years/">returned to the black</a>&nbsp;in Q3 20 after 21 consecutive quarters of losses.</p>
<p>It posted a $4.4bn profit for 2021 and last month, its new CEO, Kim Kyung-bae, announced an ambitious growth programme that will see the carrier invest $11.3bn over the next five years to expand its containership and dry bulk ship fleet.</p>
<p>HMM is ranked as the eighth-biggest carrier, with a fleet of 76 vessels and a capacity of some 800,000 teu, which is around 130,000 teu more than its The Alliance partner Yang Ming, in ninth position.&nbsp;Moreover, it has an orderbook of 184,000 teu, compared with the Taiwanese carrier&rsquo;s 24,000 teu.</p>
<p>In November, a Korean government minister said it had&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/south-korean-government-to-launch-search-for-hmm-buyer-next-year/">begun a search</a>&nbsp;for a buyer for the 45% combined stake in the carrier held by the state-owned Korea Development Bank and Korea Ocean Business Corp, but those plans appear to have been put on the back burner.&nbsp;</p>
