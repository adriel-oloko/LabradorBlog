<p>All parts of the US supply chain &mdash; not just its ports &mdash; need to move to round-the-clock operations to alleviate snarl-ups and reduce overall costs, President Joe Biden&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/former-ustranscom-commander-appointed-as-new-white-house-port-envoy/">supply-chain czar</a>&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only you or only a terminal goes to 24/7, that&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; Stephen Lyons told Port of Long Beach Executive Mario Cordero in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP1LS637EFs">an interview</a>&nbsp;Tuesday. &ldquo;But if everybody &mdash; including the warehousing community, all the other modes of transport &mdash; moved to 24/7, or something more than today, that makes logical sense that you could move much more cargo in the same period of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the height of the supply-chain crisis last year, California&rsquo;s twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach announced 24-hour longshore operations and extended gate hours for truckers. But even as backlogs have eased somewhat, round-the-clock operations at terminals&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/port-of-los-angeles-truck-gates-go-unused-as-peak-season-approaches/">remain scarce</a>, making US maritime locations&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/california-ports-key-to-us-supply-chain-rank-among-worlds-least-efficient/">less efficient</a>&nbsp;than many others worldwide.</p>

<p>Cordero has long been a proponent of adopting 24/7 operations, as most of the world&rsquo;s biggest and most efficient ports have done. Expanded, consistent gate hours could result from the ongoing labor-<a href="https://gcaptain.com/tag/west-coast-labor-talks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contract discussions</a>&nbsp;underway between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Association that represents employers, he said in June.</p>
<p>Lyons said more fluidity is key to improving the movement of cargo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about restoring consumer confidence and bringing costs down,&rdquo; Lyons said. &ldquo;What we want to do is move in that direction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
