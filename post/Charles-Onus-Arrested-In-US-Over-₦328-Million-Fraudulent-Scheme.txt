<p>United States authorities have arrested a Nigerian for computer fraud in a scheme worth about $800,000 (₦328 million).<br /><br />US Department of Justice (DoJ) in a statement said the Nigerian named Charles Onus was arrested for charges in connection with a scheme to conduct cyber intrusions of multiple user accounts maintained by a company that provides human resources and payroll services to employers across the United States, in order to steal payroll deposits.<br /><br />DoJ said Onus was arrested on April 14, 2021, in San Francisco and detained. Onus was presented on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court before Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe.<br /><br />Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said, &ldquo;Charles Onus allegedly participated in a scheme that stole nearly $1 million by hacking into a payroll processing company&rsquo;s system to access user accounts and divert payroll to prepaid debit cards he controlled.<br /><br />&ldquo;As alleged, Onus did this as effectively as someone who commits bank burglary, but with no need for a blowtorch or bolt-cutters. Thanks to the FBI and IRS-CI, Onus is in custody and facing serious federal charges.&rdquo;</p>
