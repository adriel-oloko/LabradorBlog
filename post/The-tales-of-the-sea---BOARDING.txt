Each night (if I spent it at home), I would turn on my bed eyes gazing into the skies as I fantasized about going on my adventures and coming back to tell my daring tales amongst my fellow seamen.</div><div><br></div><div>Among the seafarers my favourite was Pa Cherdley. A captain in his days, but now retired and left to work his family land rearing livestock and managing an inn.</div><div><br></div><div>The farmer was more of a title for Pa Cherdley, as he was always tending to the inn, leaving the farmwork to his wife and brothers children.</div><div><br></div><div>Pa Cherdley was most active in the evenings as most seamen in those days were. You would see him juggling over a hundred tasks, trying to keep the inn as comfortable as possible for the staying seafarers, something he understood the importance of being as an ex seafarer himself.</div><div><br></div><div>But above all one thing Pa Cherdley valued immensely was Friday nights as ships rigged to sail on Friday had to stay fast till the next Saturday, as any seafarer who knew the seas never set sail on the day the Lord was crucified.</div><div><br></div><div>So surely the inns where well packed with the crew of the ships delayed on Friday and due for Saturday.</div><div><br></div><div>Of all my Fridays at the "Pa C" my favourite was the day the whaling vessel "Lucky Gypsy", was delayed.</div><div><div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">----------~----------</div></div><div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><br><img src="https://abrex.pythonanywhere.com/post/images/image.jpeg" data-mce-src="https://abrex.pythonanywhere.com/post/images/image.jpeg"></div><div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><br></div><div><div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">Gypsy tales</div><div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">----------~----------</div><div><br></div></div><div>The Lucky Gypsy was due to leave on Thursday night but was delayed by bad weather, as custom Friday wasn't considered an option and her laycan was pushed to the noon of Saturday.</div><div><br></div><div>The master of "Lucky Gypsy" was a seafarer who quite unusually was of northern descent, he was an old mate and friend of Pa Cherdley and thought it good to use the opportunity to catch up on old times. One thing led to another and soon the tales began.</div><div><br></div><div>An unusual quietness swept the inn save for a jig that was happening at the back room an odd happening for sailors, drunk one's at that.</div><div><br></div><div>Captain Caldwell of the Lucky Gypsy stared into the flame of the lantern at the center of the table as if it spoke secrets straight to his soul.</div><div><br></div><div>Soon enough the sailor's patience started running out, smirks grew to sounds of splashing liquor refilling tumblers that emptied almost as soon they were filled up.</div><div><br></div><div>Then Caldwell let out a sigh.</div><div><br></div><div>I've told this tale countless times, most of you might even know it by heart. It's the story of my fate upon the high seas.&nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">----------~----------</div><div><br></div></div><div>This was just after the war, our good king had brought peace back to the land and seas of our nation, as well as increased our horizons.</div><div><br></div><div>Trade had begun, but as expected many a talented hands had been lost to the evil touch of death that war so mercilessly took around with it.</div><div><br></div><div>I was drawn to the life of a seafarer hanging around a table such as this, albeit much smaller, for the sea trade was not much of a considered idea for my people up North, who rather found solace in tending fields and tanning hides.</div><div><br></div><div>Wasn't long before my interest grew more than my mind could bear and I left my home for this town. Soon after I boarded a clipper headed for the west Indies as an ordinary seaman.</div><div><br></div><div>Our departure was as smooth as we prayed for. I perched on the monkey island, hoping for the best and expecting the worst, thinking about my parents left behind, and my future I was risking for my wishful thoughts. The latter not being a reason I consider much now.</div><div><br></div><div>Five days later our vessels caught in the trade winds of the West Atlantic, as we sped our way to the Odswill islands where we where to restock our already diminishing provisions. The captain since our departure was still nowhere to be found.(Had he fallen overboard, that I knew not).</div><div><br></div><div>Soon after the whales came up alongside, flowing through the water beautifully a sure sign that the waves was in our favor, an assurance of fair winds and following seas.</div><div><br></div><div>The only issue being the waves of the sea wasn't the only element in deciding the fate of our voyage, a lesson I was to learn the hard way.</div><div><br></div><div>Approaching the straits of Calgris, our lookout called out a ship approaching us, not sure if it was a fellow merchant man or the Navy. We let out a Cannon to show we had seen them.</div><div><br></div><div>The custom as it still is was for the approaching vessel to reply our greeting with a similar cannon fire.</div><div><br></div><div>We waited silently expecting the reply, soon enough it dawned upon us that we had fallen upon a privateers clipper, one of the worst things a seaman might encounter on his first voyage.</div><div><br></div><div>She drew upon us slowly but steady on her course, clearly the work of a good helmsman, her crew littered her sides calmly waiting to board her vessel and loot our holds dry.</div>
