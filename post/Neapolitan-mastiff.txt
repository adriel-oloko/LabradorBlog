<div class="breed-info__content-wrap">
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been to Jurassic Park, you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like a Mastino. These majestic guardians of startling appearance are massive, powerful dogs. The U.S. Neapolitan Mastiff Club describes their dog&rsquo;s head as &ldquo;astounding&rdquo;&mdash;and give them credit for hitting upon just the right adjective. The profuse hanging wrinkles and folds, and pendulous lips, make a Mastino look like a marzipan Mastiff that&rsquo;s been out in the sun too long. And yet, the breed&rsquo;s inner dignity and nobility can only be described as beautiful.</p>
