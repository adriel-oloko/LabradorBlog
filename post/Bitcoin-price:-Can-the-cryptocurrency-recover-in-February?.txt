<p>Historically, bitcoin has<strong>&nbsp;positive returns in February</strong>, which could give traders some hope as technical indicators suggest short-term buyers could stay active around the $35,000-$37,000 support area, but upside looks to be limited toward&nbsp;<strong>$45,000</strong>. Despite the recent spike in price, some analysts are still skeptical of BTC due to the&nbsp;<strong>Biden&nbsp;</strong>administration preparing to release an executive order in February to regulate bitcoin as a matter of&nbsp;<strong>national security</strong>.</p>
<div class=" ue-c-article__embedded">It's hard to predict if the<strong>&nbsp;new regulations</strong>&nbsp;will have a positive or negative impact on the digital coin, so the crypto market remains highly volatile. Even though history points to positive returns in February,&nbsp;<strong>bitcoin could end up falling for a third consecutive month</strong>.</div>

<div class=" ue-c-article__embedded">
<p>Bitcoin produced an average&nbsp;<strong>return of 12% in February</strong>&nbsp;throughout the past nine years. The second month of the calendar finishes with a gain over 85% of the time.</p>
<p>As the crypto market stabilized to end January, investors poured<strong>&nbsp;22.1 million into bitcoin-focused funds</strong>&nbsp;last week, the second consecutive week of money inflow into BTC. Despite one of its worst-ever starts to a year, crypto funds saw inflows of $19 million during the seven days through January 28.</p>
